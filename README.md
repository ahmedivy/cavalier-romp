# Cricket App (CLI)

A cricket related python program that uses APIs to performs functions
related to cricket (like live score of matches, upcoming schedules,
ICC rankings, ICC standings in current tournaments and Latest News etc.)

Code is not as much efficient as it should 🥺, because it was my first Python Project, but it works.

### Here's the screenshot (PS: it can do more than that 🙃):
